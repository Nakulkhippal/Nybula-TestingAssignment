# Nybula-TestingAssignment
This Repository had the assignment for Software Testing role for Nybula. 

For this testing we firstly open our eclipse and install all the needed programs and drivers such as selenium,  chrome web driver etc.


**Initially, Chrome should be closed i.e. No Chrome Tab should be opened, as we need our program to start chrome with our existing default chrome profile. Make sure you have no chrome tab opened or it will throw an Exception.**
